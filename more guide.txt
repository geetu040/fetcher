Hi,
So we have 2 characters
Red is called FETCHER
Blue is called TARGET

The Fetcher is supposed to find its way through the maze and get to the target

You can control the movement of fetcher by the arrow keys
You can also automate the fetcher to catch the target

To automate you have three options
Model 1: Euler [Accuracy: 0.9992, loss: 0.0031]
It tries to find the path that gives shortest hypotenues from target to fetcher.
Model 2: Absolute [Accuracy: 0.9998, loss: 0.0028]
It finds the shortest path by adding base and perpendicular.
Model 3: Human [Accuracy: 0.9919, loss: 0.0432]
It works like a person does, it doesnot care for the hypotenues or base or perpendicular
 
- All 3 models are based on deep neural networks formed by tensorflow and keras
- Dataset for euler and absolute models are generated by code
- Dataset for human model is prepared by playing the game
- Datasets have been treated with sklearn models as well, but deep neural networks showed a better accuracy and thus were chosen
- Convolutional Neural Networks were also practised but again could not beat the accuracy
- Final model is a dense model which uses 8 inputs
	possiton of fetcher at x-axis, scaled float between 0 and 1
	possiton of fetcher at y-axis, scaled float between 0 and 1
	possiton of target at x-axis, scaled float between 0 and 1
	possiton of target at y-axis, scaled float between 0 and 1
	can the fetcher move up?, boolian either 0 or 1
	can the fetcher move left?, boolian either 0 or 1
	can the fetcher move down?, boolian either 0 or 1
	can the fetcer move right?, boolian either 0 or 1
- The model also uses the concept of recurrent neural network
- It doesn't use rnn directly rather in an indirect way
- Whatever was the output of previous prediction, it is used to manipulate the available directions for next output

The model is not a cent percent accuracy therefore we see some fallcies but only for the human model
- 1 in a hunderand times it will walk over the obstacles
- rarely it may get stuck in a loop and never meets the target, in that case after the fetcher takes more than 100 steps, the target is just repositioned
